It's compatible with 8088 (the original IBM PC)

If you want to assemble it, you must download the Netwide Assembler
(*nasm*) from www.nasm.us

Use this command line:

> nasm -f bin lights.asm -l rogue.lst -o lights.img
>
> nasm -f bin lights.asm -Dcom_file=1 -o lights.com


## HOW TO PLAY

The computer will choose a sequence, and then you must
enter the same sequence of numbers by pressing these on
the keyboard.

The sequence then will be repeated with an added number,
you win the game when you reach a sequence of 31 lights.
